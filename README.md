# Introduction

This Cookbook contains examples and tutorials to help developers build AI systems with copy/paste code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects.

## About me

I'm Dave, an AI engineer and founder of Datalumina. I run an AI development company, and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar?sub_confirmation=1), I share practical tutorials that teach you how to build AI systems that actually work in the real world.

### My other work

Beyond this cookbook, I've created a few other resources that might help you depending on where you are in your career.

If you're completely new to AI and just getting started with Python, I have a [free five-hour course](https://youtu.be/ygXn5nV5qFc) that covers everything you need to know to build a solid foundation.

If you're already comfortable with the basics and want to go deeper, I run a program where I teach developers [how to build and deploy end-to-end GenAI solutions](https://go.datalumina.com/CkIsMAK) using the same approach we use for our agency clients.

And if you're a skilled developer or data professional looking to go independent, I can help you [land your first client](https://go.datalumina.com/MVWhVn9).
