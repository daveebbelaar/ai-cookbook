# MCP Crash Course Educational Module

## Overview

This educational module provides a comprehensive learning experience that teaches both the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and professional software development practices. Students will learn through a structured workflow that mirrors real-world development processes.

## Learning Philosophy

This course follows a "dual-purpose" educational approach:
1. **Technical Skills**: Master MCP concepts and implementation
2. **Professional Workflow**: Learn proper development practices through hands-on experience with GitHub, issues, PRs, and collaborative development
